# Feature-and-Data-Subset-Selection-for-Contextual-Anomaly-Detection-
I will upload all the resources(including papers, codes, ideas, projects) related to Feature Selection, Data Subset Selection, Anomaly Detection, Hybrid Modelling that I have found onto this repository. 

They are roughly five types of resources that will be uploaded as follows:
1. Feature Selection resources
2. Anomaly/Outlier Detection resources
3. Data Subset Selection resources
4. Hybrid Modelling resources
5. Other resources, i.e., any possible combination of the four abovementioned subjects, such as Feature Selection for Anomaly Detection, Data Subset Selection for Anomaly Detection, etc.
